      <description>Riot Champion Trends and Item Recommender is a data science project where I analyze and visualize a user&amp;rsquo;s performance in League of Legends. I compare their playing history data against a list of professional or similar ranking player&amp;rsquo;s game history data using R.
To obtain the list of professional players game data, I built a Python web crawler using the requests library and RIOT API to scrape their game data, storing them into JSON files.</description>

      <description>Develop a cloud-based framework to enable users to analyze and study changes over the development history of a software system to better understand when, how, and to what extent developers influence software quality attributes. Introduce new features in frontend to visualize data as well as conduct real-time machine learning techniques on presented data. Visualize and construct a Tensorflow.js predictive model for predicting when, how, and to what extent developers influence software quality attributes.</description>

      <description>Based off the classic game Bomberman, my team of 8 people tackle how agents acomplish tasks with infinitely meaningful variations through competitive multi-agent learning. Our team was split betwen two teams; Pytorch and TensorForce, with the goal of seeing if different frameworks lead to different results but trying the same algorithms being PPO and A2C.
We leverage pre-existing architecture and code from Pommerman Competition as cited below.

      <description>I led two fellow students to develop a Python recomendation system for suggesting ratings for a user&amp;rsquo;s review through collabortive filters and machine learning algorithms achieving our highest accuracy of 89%. We narrated and presented our findings in the Amazon project to a group of our peers in that we found common singular words and n-grams used when describing a project. At the end of the project, we were able to build a prediction model where given a sentence it recommended a star rating from 1 being the worst to 5 being the best for the given sentence.</description>

      <description>I led a team of three to build an Automated Visualzing Application, AVA, for helping musicians visualize their music by analyzing musical notes and tones. AVA is based on machine learning model using Hidden Markov Chains (HNMs) and a Neural Netowrk created by Pybrain. She can detect pitch, rhythm, beat times and more helping musicians visualize their music while also providing album art. We model our project after the iTunes Visualizer but also incorporate an album art to the accompaning piece.</description>

      <description>Mobile game designed for children ages five to nine in an effort to teach youths about cultural literacy while being imformative but also fun. Leading a team of five, we were introduced to the agile methodology as we worked with our client. To develop this came we taught ourselves Lua and Corona SDK over the course of the semester. The game is live and on the itunes app store!</description>

No content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html
Setting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.
This implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js
Initial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml
[outputs] home = [&amp;quot;HTML&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;JSON&amp;quot;]  Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.</description>
