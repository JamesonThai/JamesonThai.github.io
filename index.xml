      <description>Riot Champion Trends and Item Recommender is a data science project where I analyze and visualize a user&amp;rsquo;s performance in League of Legends. I compare their playing history data against a list of professional or similar ranking player&amp;rsquo;s game history data using R.
To obtain the list of professional players game data, I built a Python web crawler using the requests library and RIOT API to scrape their game data, storing them into JSON files.</description>

      <description>Based off the classic game Bomberman, my team of 8 people tackle how agents acomplish tasks with infinitely meaningful variations through competitive multi-agent learning. Our team was split betwen two teams; Pytorch and TensorForce, with the goal of seeing if different frameworks lead to different results but trying the same algorithms being PPO and A2C.
We leverage pre-existing architecture and code from Pommerman Competition as cited below.

      <description>I led two fellow students to develop a Python recomendation system for suggesting ratings for a user&amp;rsquo;s review through collabortive filters and machine learning algorithms achieving our highest accuracy of 89%.
Goals Acquire Amazon Dataset Exploratory analysis of dataset Use ML Algorithms to predict review ratings Build Jupyter notebook to predict ratings Visualize preprocessed information and compiled Bag Of Words Present findings to general and informed audience  Algorithms  KNN Naive Bayes Ordered Logistic Regression Linear SVM Doc2Vec Decision Trees  Dataset We filtered the initial dataset of over 12 million reviews (12 GB) into five separate data frames corresponding to their star ratings using Pandas.</description>

      <description>I led a team of three to build an Automated Visualzing Application, AVA, for helping musicians visualize their music by analyzing musical notes and tones. AVA is based on machine learning model using Hidden Markov Chains (HNMs) and a Neural Netowrk created by Pybrain. She can detect pitch, rhythm, beat times and more helping musicians visualize their music while also providing album art. We model our project after the iTunes Visualizer but also incorporate an album art to the accompaning piece.</description>

      <description>Mobile game designed for children ages five to nine in an effort to teach youths about cultural literacy while being imformative but also fun. Leading a team of five, we were introduced to the agile methodology as we worked with our client. To develop this came we taught ourselves Lua and Corona SDK over the course of the semester. The game is live and on the itunes app store!</description>

      <description>This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.
No content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html
Setting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.
This implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js
Initial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml
[outputs] home = [&amp;quot;HTML&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;JSON&amp;quot;]  Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.</description>
