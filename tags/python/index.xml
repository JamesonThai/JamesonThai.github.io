      <description>Riot Champion Trends and Item Recommender is a data science project where I analyze and visualize a user&amp;rsquo;s performance in League of Legends. I compare their playing history data against a list of professional or similar ranking player&amp;rsquo;s game history data using R.
To obtain the list of professional players game data, I built a Python web crawler using the requests library and RIOT API to scrape their game data, storing them into JSON files.</description>

      <description>Develop a cloud-based framework to enable users to analyze and study changes over the development history of a software system to better understand when, how, and to what extent developers influence software quality attributes. Introduce new features in frontend to visualize data as well as conduct real-time machine learning techniques on presented data. Visualize and construct a Tensorflow.js predictive model for predicting when, how, and to what extent developers influence software quality attributes.</description>

      <description>Based off the classic game Bomberman, my team of 8 people tackle how agents acomplish tasks with infinitely meaningful variations through competitive multi-agent learning. Our team was split betwen two teams; Pytorch and TensorForce, with the goal of seeing if different frameworks lead to different results but trying the same algorithms being PPO and A2C.
We leverage pre-existing architecture and code from Pommerman Competition as cited below.

      <title>Amazon Reviews - Sentiment Analysis</title>

      <description>I led two fellow students to develop a Python recomendation system for suggesting ratings for a user&amp;rsquo;s review through collabortive filters and machine learning algorithms achieving our highest accuracy of 89%. We narrated and presented our findings in the Amazon project to a group of our peers in that we found common singular words and n-grams used when describing a project. At the end of the project, we were able to build a prediction model where given a sentence it recommended a star rating from 1 being the worst to 5 being the best for the given sentence.</description>

      <description>This was a 10 week internship from June 2019 - August 2019
 What was achieved  Developed Python image identification  model for identifying any DC Universe characters in a given DC Universe comic page achieving 76% accuracy. Presented project architecture and model&amp;rsquo;s layer activation to WB executive, data intelligence team, and DCU stakeholders. Deployed Python web crawler that collects and parses DC comic images of any DC Universe Character.</description>
