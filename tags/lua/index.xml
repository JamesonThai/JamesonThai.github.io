      <description>Mobile game designed for children ages five to nine in an effort to teach youths about cultural literacy while being imformative but also fun. Leading a team of five, we were introduced to the agile methodology as we worked with our client. To develop this came we taught ourselves Lua and Corona SDK over the course of the semester. The game is live and on the itunes app store!</description>
