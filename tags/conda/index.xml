      <description>Based off the classic game Bomberman, my team of 8 people tackle how agents acomplish tasks with infinitely meaningful variations through competitive multi-agent learning. Our team was split betwen two teams; Pytorch and TensorForce, with the goal of seeing if different frameworks lead to different results but trying the same algorithms being PPO and A2C.
We leverage pre-existing architecture and code from Pommerman Competition as cited below.

      <description>I led two fellow students to develop a Python recomendation system for suggesting ratings for a user&amp;rsquo;s review through collabortive filters and machine learning algorithms achieving our highest accuracy of 89%. We narrated and presented our findings in the Amazon project to a group of our peers in that we found common singular words and n-grams used when describing a project. At the end of the project, we were able to build a prediction model where given a sentence it recommended a star rating from 1 being the worst to 5 being the best for the given sentence.</description>
