      <description>Develop a cloud-based framework to enable users to analyze and study changes over the development history of a software system to better understand when, how, and to what extent developers influence software quality attributes. Introduce new features in frontend to visualize data as well as conduct real-time machine learning techniques on presented data. Visualize and construct a Tensorflow.js predictive model for predicting when, how, and to what extent developers influence software quality attributes.</description>

      <description>I led two fellow students to develop a Python recomendation system for suggesting ratings for a user&amp;rsquo;s review through collabortive filters and machine learning algorithms achieving our highest accuracy of 89%.
Goals Acquire Amazon Dataset Exploratory analysis of dataset Use ML Algorithms to predict review ratings Build Jupyter notebook to predict ratings Visualize preprocessed information and compiled Bag Of Words Present findings to general and informed audience  Algorithms  KNN Naive Bayes Ordered Logistic Regression Linear SVM Doc2Vec Decision Trees  Dataset We filtered the initial dataset of over 12 million reviews (12 GB) into five separate data frames corresponding to their star ratings using Pandas.</description>
