      <description>Develop a cloud-based framework to enable users to analyze and study changes over the development history of a software system to better understand when, how, and to what extent developers influence software quality attributes. Introduce new features in frontend to visualize data as well as conduct real-time machine learning techniques on presented data. Visualize and construct a Tensorflow.js predictive model for predicting when, how, and to what extent developers influence software quality attributes.</description>

      <description>I led two fellow students to develop a Python recomendation system for suggesting ratings for a user&amp;rsquo;s review through collabortive filters and machine learning algorithms achieving our highest accuracy of 89%. We narrated and presented our findings in the Amazon project to a group of our peers in that we found common singular words and n-grams used when describing a project. At the end of the project, we were able to build a prediction model where given a sentence it recommended a star rating from 1 being the worst to 5 being the best for the given sentence.</description>
