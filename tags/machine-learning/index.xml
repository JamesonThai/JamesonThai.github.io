      <description>Based off the classic game Bomberman, my team of 8 people tackle how agents acomplish tasks with infinitely meaningful variations through competitive multi-agent learning. Our team was split betwen two teams; Pytorch and TensorForce, with the goal of seeing if different frameworks lead to different results but trying the same algorithms being PPO and A2C.
We leverage pre-existing architecture and code from Pommerman Competition as cited below.
