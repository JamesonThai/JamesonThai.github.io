      <description>Develop a cloud-based framework to enable users to analyze and study changes over the development history of a software system to better understand when, how, and to what extent developers influence software quality attributes. Introduce new features in frontend to visualize data as well as conduct real-time machine learning techniques on presented data. Visualize and construct a Tensorflow.js predictive model for predicting when, how, and to what extent developers influence software quality attributes.</description>

      <description>I led a team of three to build an Automated Visualzing Application, AVA, for helping musicians visualize their music by analyzing musical notes and tones. AVA is based on machine learning model using Hidden Markov Chains (HNMs) and a Neural Netowrk created by Pybrain. She can detect pitch, rhythm, beat times and more helping musicians visualize their music while also providing album art. We model our project after the iTunes Visualizer but also incorporate an album art to the accompaning piece.</description>
