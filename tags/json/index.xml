      <description>Riot Champion Trends and Item Recommender is a data science project where I analyze and visualize a user&amp;rsquo;s performance in League of Legends. I compare their playing history data against a list of professional or similar ranking player&amp;rsquo;s game history data using R.
To obtain the list of professional players game data, I built a Python web crawler using the requests library and RIOT API to scrape their game data, storing them into JSON files.</description>

      <description>I led two fellow students to develop a Python recomendation system for suggesting ratings for a user&amp;rsquo;s review through collabortive filters and machine learning algorithms achieving our highest accuracy of 89%. We narrated and presented our findings in the Amazon project to a group of our peers in that we found common singular words and n-grams used when describing a project. At the end of the project, we were able to build a prediction model where given a sentence it recommended a star rating from 1 being the worst to 5 being the best for the given sentence.</description>

      <description>Mobile game designed for children ages five to nine in an effort to teach youths about cultural literacy while being imformative but also fun. Leading a team of five, we were introduced to the agile methodology as we worked with our client. To develop this came we taught ourselves Lua and Corona SDK over the course of the semester. The game is live and on the itunes app store!</description>
